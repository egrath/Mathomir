<H1><A NAME="idh_mouse"></A>Basic mouse operations</H1>

<P>There are four basic mouse operations: Touch, Pick-up, Carry, Place-down</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Touch an object (the square root in this example)
<br><img src=".\touch.bmp"></LI>
	<LI>Pick up its copy (left mouse click)
<br><img src=".\pickup.bmp"></LI>
	<LI>Carry it wherever you want
<br><img src=".\carry.bmp"></LI>
	<LI>Touch where you want to place it down (the insertion point between ‘14’ and ‘z’ in this example)
<br><img src=".\touch2.bmp"></LI>
	<LI>Place-down the carried object by left mouse click
<br><img src=".\placedown.bmp"></LI>
</OL>

<P><B><I>Touching </I></B>– aim the mouse pointer at an object and it will highlight blue. By pointing at right spots you can touch whole expressions and even whole equations... 
<UL>
<LI>To touch more than one object (<I>multi-touch</I>), hold down the Shift key (or mouse button) and move the pointer over the equation.</LI>
<LI>You can also touch <I>insertion points</I>. Touched insertion point is represented by blue or green line (as in the step 4. of the example above).</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>Picking-up</I> </B>and <B><I>carrying </I></B>– once you touched something, mouse-click to pick up a copy of it. The copy can then be carried away with your mouse.
<UL>
<LI>The mouse arrow becomes black when you carry anything.</LI>
<LI>You can always throw away whatever you carry by pressing the Esc key, or by right-click at empty document area.</LI>
</UL>
<small>Note: Instead of copy, you can cut touched object by holding the mouse button down for a longer time (a long-click) while you performing the pick-up action. The effect is the same as if you used Ctrl+X (cut).</small>


<P><B><I>Placing-down</I></B> – you can place down the carried object by mouse click. There are several distinguished ways to place-down:</P>

<UL>
<LI><b>Over other object(s)</b>– touch object(s) while you carry something and then mouse-click. The touched object(s) will be replaced</LI>
<LI><b>At an insertion point</b> – touch an insertion point while you carry something and then mouse-click. The carried objects are inserted.</LI>
<LI><b>At empty document area</b> – point the mouse button at empty area while you carry something and mouse-click. A new object is created.</LI>
</UL>
<a name="InsertionPoint">
<p><b>The Insertion Point</b></p></a>

<P>The <I>Insertion point</I> is a place (usually between two elements in an equation) where you can insert new elements. When touched, the insertion point is visible as a blue or green line. Two things can happen if you left-mouse-click at an insertion point:

<UL>
	<LI>if you carried something, this will be inserted here</LI>
	<LI>if you didn’t carry anything, the <I><a href="KeyboardStart.htm">keyboard entry mode</a></I> will start</LI>
</UL>
