<H1><A NAME="idh_handdrawing"></A>Hand-drawing with Math-o-mir</H1>

<P>You can make simple drawings with Math-o-mir hand-drawing tools. The hand-drawing tools are found at the bottom of the Toolbox. Among others you will find simple freehand-drawing-tool, erasers, coordinate-system-drawing-tools, logarithmic and linear networks...</P>

<P>As soon as you choose any drawing tool, you will enter the hand-drawing mode - mouse pointer changes to a pencil shape. </P>

<P>Once the hand-drawing mode is active, you can draw by mouse click-and-drag action. Use following key-strokes for easier drawing:</P>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl - temporarily exits the drawing mode so you can handle your objects. In addition, it allows <B>node editing</B></li>
<li>Alt - temporarily enables/disables snap-to-grid (inside drawing boxes it enables snap-to-point instead)</li>
<li>F4 or long right-mouse-click - starts the hand-drawing mode and shows a handy drawing toolbox (last used tool is preselected)</li>
<li>Shift - can be held down for special effects (horizontal/vertical lines, perfect squares/circles/triangles...). Alternatively, you can draw with with both mouse buttons pressed for the same effect</li>
</ul>
<small>
<P>Note that you can use quick-typing feature even while the hand-drawing mode is active - just point you mouse pointer and start typing. This is handy way to label your drawings without need to exit the hand-drawing mode.</P></small>

<P>To exit hand-drawing mode, press the Esc key or right click at empty document area.</P>

<P>While the drawing mode is not active (the mouse pointer has its standard shape) you can work with hand-drawings in a similar way as with text and math equations. You can touch or select more than one drawing by holding down the shift key. You can right click on drawing(s) and then group/ungroup, change line width, change size, rotate, align, or start node-edit mode. Drawings can be moved by mouse click-and-drag action. A drawing can also be copied (then carried and placed down) by clicking on it. Selected drawings can be stretched (left mouse click-and-drag on the red stretching handle) or rotated (right mouse click-and-drag on the red stretching handle).</P>
