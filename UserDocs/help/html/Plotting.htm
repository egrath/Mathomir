<P>Properly written expressions can be plotted using the Function Plotter box. Choose the plotter box from the Toolbox and place it  into your document.</P>

<P>At the picture below, there is an example of  the Function Plotter box</P>

controls
<UL>
<LI>- zoom in – after you click on it, you are able to select (click-and-drag) an area of the function plot that you wish to zoom in.</LI>
<LI>- zoom out – click to zoom out<br>
<LI>- auto-range – click to repaint the function and auto-adjust y-coordinate range (x-coordinate range is not changed)<br>
<LI>- linear / logarithmic – circularly changes: lin/lin, log/lin, log/log, lin/log<br>
<LI>- range arrow – there are four arrows (only one shown at the picture). You can click on the arrow to type-in the exact coordinate range... Another way to modify the range is by click-and-drag action on coordinate (gray) area.<br>
<LI>- function definition buttons – click if you want to see/edit the function displayed. Up to three functions can be displayed (black, green and red colored)
<LI>- analysis - click to display local minimum/maximum of ploted functions and intersection points of two functions</P>
</UL>
<P>The easiest way to plot a function is to simply write the function somewhere near the Function Plotter box, and then pick it up (by mouse) and drop it to the Function Plotter box. You can also drop the function directly to any of three function definition buttons. </P>

<P>Math-o-mir can only plot expressions of single variable (more than one variable in the expression will produce stupid result). If your expression is in form of equation, only the right side is considered for plotting (the right side must have only one single variable). </P>
