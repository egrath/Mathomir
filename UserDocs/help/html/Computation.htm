<P><I>NOTE:</I> <I>If you find this feature annoying or unneeded, please disable it by unchecking: Options-&gt;Symbolic computation-&gt;Enable.</I></P>

<P>You can use symbolic calculator for basic algebra computation, number rounding and variable extraction. In order to use this feature, you have to touch (either whole or a part of) expression/equation and right-mose-click on it. The context menu will appear, and any calculated option will be listed at the bottom of it.</P>

<P>If you right-click to a variable within an equation, the Math-o-mir will extract the variable to the left side of equation.</P>

<P>When a result is proposed by Math-o-mir in the context menu, you will find two mini-buttons just right of the proposed calculations. The black triangle will create new, modified, expression just below the original one. The black square will ‘hook’ the result to your mouse and you will be able drop it anywhere you want.</P>

<P>Simple systems of equations (linear mostly) can be solved by selecting all relevant equations (drag the selection frame around them) and by right-clicking on the selection. The Math-o-mir will suppose that all variables are unknowns....</P>
<img src=".\computation3.bmp">
<P>More generally, you can also solve systems of equations by ‘manual’ substitution: pick-up one equation, and (carrying it) right-click at a variable in other equation. The Math-o-mir will extract the variable from the first equation and substitute all occurrences in the other equation. </P>
