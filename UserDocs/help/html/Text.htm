<H2>Entering a plain text</H2>

<P>To enter a plain text you need to activate the <b>text-typing mode</b>. <P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P><big><b>ALT+Spacebar</b> </big>toggles between math-typing and text-typing mode.
<br>(Alternatively, you can configure the CapsLock key to be used for the same purpose)</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The color of the blinking cursor indicates what typing mode is currently active:
<UL>
<big>
<LI>Blue cursor - the math-typing mode is active</li>
<LI>Green cursor - the text-typing mode is active</li>
</big>
</UL>

<P><B>Alternative ways to start plain text entry</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>while a box is still <b>entirely empty</b> you can use the <b>spacebar key</b> (in addition to Alt+spacebar) to toggle the typing mode</LI>
<LI>you can mouse-click at the sigma sign in the text-control box to switch into text-typing mode (the text-control box will change its color to green)</LI>
<LI>instead of using single mouse click to start a box, you can <b>double-click</b> to start a box that already has the text typing mode  activated</LI>
<LI>you can define a <a href="Guidelines.htm">text guideline</a> - by clicking on it, the new box is started and will have the text typing mode activated</LI>
<LI>you can just start typing plain text even if the math-typing mode is still active - after several keystrokes Math-o-mir will revert into text-typing mode (this only works if your text entry started from an empty box, if your typing speed is sufficient and if you don't use some math operators)
