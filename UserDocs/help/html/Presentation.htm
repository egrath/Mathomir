<P>In the Presentation mode your equations will look better but will be harder to edit. You can togle between the Presentation mode  and the Edit mode by using the F5 key.</P>

<P>In presentation mode you can also use halftone rendering if you want. Presentation mode, especially when the halftone rendering is on, is quite CPU power hungry.</P>

<P>When you send your document to printer, it will be printed in either Presentation or Edit mode, whatever is currently active. The Presentation mode offers better WYSIWYG experience because relative object sizes and positions remain fixed.
